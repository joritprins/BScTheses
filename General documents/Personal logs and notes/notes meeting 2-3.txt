Abstract: no abbreviations

what are you measuring. What experiments will you have. Make explicit, goal measuring question (see lastt part) Between 3.1 and 3.2 and after that the technical details. 

In section 3 give specific names multiple device exmperiments for example
Now I describe the results of the multiple device experiments

Just improvement => add x

Potential resons why could include
Future work, from these mesurements the tendency is not clear and future work could investigate that in more detail (the correlation between bandwidth and energy consumption)

RQa and RQb or no title with them

Chapter 5 discussion
revisit the research questions
Chapter 6 conclusion
Threaths for validity
Future works
