Tip: do more experiments
Change data to pretrained neural network
Continue with 2 devices, not on what causes the peaks
Is this enough? Depends on the analysis
Ask questions

Results are in watt and total is energy consumption so multiply with time to get Watt Hours

Change title plots after 50 runs to Mean power usage of 50 runs
Timeframe => kijk de runtimes and show that thay are all in around 60 seconds

Save time on section 2
2.3 (cheetah) not to detailed
