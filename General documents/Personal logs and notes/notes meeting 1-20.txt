Writing in parralel to testing
Title page + abstract
Introduction looks good
Section 2 improved -> 2.4 not finished
2.5 already contains partly my work
Section 3 (-> title, change it? Check it in canvas?)
- 2.5 is my work and answering research question so to my work
- 4.1 here in section 3
Section 4 -> experimental results
___ or
Sections according to research question



----------------
First do some hypoteshis
check de results are they counter intuitive

4g or 5g -> motivate the bandwidths chosen -> under 50mbits

4g up to 100mbits
4g bandwidth
https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/cellular-data-and-digital-divide/ -> wireless technologies
Goes for both ways because if the client supports 3g it sends and recieves this low

threats to validity
things that i did not consider 
generalisation about the topic -> what about other Neural Neworks ->  think about what i should have done but didnt because of time
What if i picked another neural network -> would the results be totally different. 
internal validity (did i measure what i wanted to measure, did not measure the routers -> what are the missing elements), external validity (how can i generalise to things that i did not test), emperical research.
