one overall question 
keep it simple and expand when we have time

The choice of clarifiying what SNNI we use is not a reasearch question, but we still need to clarify why we use it. Something like this implementation has the best code that we can use and build upon can be a clarification

what are energy implication of snni (main)
how do we measure energy (subquestion)
subquestions: (independend variables)
measure difference between energy on client side and on server side (subquestion)
without SNNI testing, plaintext and not encrypted, what is the energy overhead (subquestion)
discussion = energy consumption on the way, like in a router, we cannot measure. Clarify what the drawbacks are of this method and say the things we cannot measure.

laptop easier, desktop more interesting and realistic but harder to setup.

writing and seting up skeletion at the same time as implementing the setup and researching and reading papers

change e.a. in references to et al.
