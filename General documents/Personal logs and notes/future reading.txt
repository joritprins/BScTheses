=============================== secure neural network inference, privacy-preserving inference, oblivious prediction =========================

To foster privacy and data governance, a key dimension of trustworthy AI, there is a need for approaches that enable DL while ensuring that security and privacy requirements are met

In the inference phase, security and privacy become a concern if the NN and the input are held by different parties. This is the case in the “Machine Learning as a Service” (MLaaS) scenario

Research if for example picture of a cat (after encryption) is still visible for the human eye. 

In order to give an indication about the practicality of these approaches, the popular databases MNIST [57] and CIFAR-10 [104] are often used to verify and benchmark the privacypreserving inference

====A comparison between interactive and non-interactive SNNIs
Homomorphic Encryption
This shows that FHE approaches get faster but cannot be considered practical yet: e.g., SHE manages to achieve over 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10 but each single inference on encrypted input takes almost 40 minutes

Garbled circuits
The structure of the NN is known to both parties. Thus, the last secrecy goal from § 3.2.2 is not met, but Yao’s protocol ensures that the parties do not learn each other’s inputs.

Titel: The quest for the best SNNI
A particular application context in which SNNI could play an important role is the Internet of Things (IoT) and the related edge computing paradigm [106,119]. A challenge of this application context is that the resources available especially on the client side are severely constrained. This limits the applicability of interactive approaches that put a significant burden on the client. Devising efficient approaches for this context remains a challenging and important task for future research
