The advances in machine learning have revealed its
great potential for emerging mobile applications such as face
recognition and voice assistant. Models trained via a Neural
Network (NN) can offer accurate and efficient inference services for mobile users. 

For example, Delphi [4] and MiniONN [5] proceed the inference
tasks between the mobile device and the model owner, while
continuous interaction is involved between them during secure
computation. Namely, both parties have to be online and
connected throughout the entire inference process. It is noteworthy that the above rigid operational confinement might not
be always feasible in cellular networks.
